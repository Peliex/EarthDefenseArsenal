# Earth Defense Arsenal
## In-progress mission + weapon completion tracker and reference guide

Currently (and probably forever) only for EDF 6

## Design Goals
* Complete Mission list for all available missions, their level brackets
* Ability to filter for missions by weapon and weapons by mission
* Loadout creator
* Technical internal game information (with the option to turn it off)

As well as the above, this site will serve to be a location for sharing strategies pertaining to each individual weapon and mission, similar to wikia and atwiki, but additionally providing modding related information and data analysis.

This guide is intended for end users at surface level only, and all advanced features are more likely useful to speedrunning and modding circles.
